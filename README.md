# Cost Of Living
The Compensation and Cost of Living Supporting System provides users an insight into the living quality in an area based on their income and personal household needs. In this system, users can select any metropolitan area from the list and their income with a selection of specific requirements such as the size of household, the score of a school district, and crime rate. The project can generate a tailored analytic report for users that illustrates whether it would be good to live in the area.

As this is a capstone project for the CS 5934 class, the main stakeholders for this system are our professor, Dr. Hooshangi, and the development team. The development team contains five roles: the project manager, front-end developer, back-end developer, data engineer, and UX designer. The end-user for this project is anyone looking for advice or information regarding living quality in a major metropolitan area in the U.S. based on their current household needs and income.
